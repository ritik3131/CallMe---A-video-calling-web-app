CallMe - A video calling web app
=========================

This is Nodejs video calling app.In this app we can chat will the other user in real time and for this purpose socket.io is used.
For getting live video stream of the user I have used peer.js As we login all other users get the message that _name is joined in the chat box.
And ohter user can also able to see the live video stream of new user joined.
And this total flow is managed by socket.io
